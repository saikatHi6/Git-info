===========GIT=============
1.Git is a persistent map
2. A stupid content tracker
3. A reviosion control system
4. A branch is a referance to a commit
5. HEAD is just referance to a branch(pointer to a pointer)
6. Git care about only object in the database not working directory. Object of a database is immutable and persistent
7. Git use garbage collector mechanisam to clean commits which not being tracked by any HEAD/Branches
8. Git switch/checkout can be use to change the branch. But checkout need to be use for commit(checkout commitHash)
9. Rebase Vs Merge -> Merge use for manitaining the commit history where rebase is refactoring the commit history(make it singale line)
10. git cat-file -t <commitHash> (show me the type of this object)
11. git cat-file -p <commitHash> (show me the content)
12. Branch vs Tag --> Branch can move to other commit but tag not.Tag is fixed.
13. git show-ref main (to show commit referance for local and remote branch)
14. git fetch and merge then push
